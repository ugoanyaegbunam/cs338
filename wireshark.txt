2. port 13
3. Specification and identification of applications when multiple could be used on the same network. Using a certain port lets you know where it's happening and standardizing it makes it even easier.
4. 4	0.071062639	129.6.15.29	192.168.16.128	DAYTIME	105	DAYTIME Response
5. [SYN] refers to a synchronization packet and [ACK] refers to an acknowledgment of the sequence number sent in the packet
6. The daytime server initiated it and we know this because the frame 6	0.071412415	129.6.15.29	192.168.16.128	TCP	60	13 → 56900 [FIN, PSH, ACK] Seq=52 Ack=1 Win=64240 Len=0 contains the [FIN] identifier
  which refers to the termination of a connection and has the source ip of the daytime server and comes before the next frame containing a [FIN] that comes from us.

===== QUESTIONS  =====
What exactly do we gain/ what can we infer from length?
I was gonna ask about [PSH] but I imagine it's push?
Why is my device requessting things that aren't there, on what grounds is it making that assumption that the item was there?
