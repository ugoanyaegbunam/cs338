level 0:
  password is bandit0, it is on the page for level 0
level 0->1:
  password is ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If. Level 0->1 page says that the password is in a file called readme. use "cat readme" to see the contents of the file.
  Then you have to exit and ssh again but instead of bandit0 do bandit 1 with the new password.
level 1->2:
  password is 263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx. You get this by doing cat < - which essentially funnels the file named "-" as the input for the cat command
level 2->3:
  password is MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx. You get this by running cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename which handles the spaces in the filename with backslashes. 
  Can also just put the whole filename in quotes.
level 3->4:
  password is 2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ. You get this from running "cd inhere" to switch the directory and then "ls -a" to display hidden files along with everything else.
level 4->5:
  password is 4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw. I got this from "cd inhere" to switch directories. Then was to lazy to type out file for each individual file I saw so I did research
  and found "find . -type f -name '*file*' -exec file {} \;" which listed all of them for me and then I ran "cat ./-file07" because it was the only one with ascii text contents
level 5->6:
  password is HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG. I got this from "cd inhere" then "du -b -a -t -1033" and then i ran "cat ./maybehere07/.file2" because that was the file that fit the size description
level 6->7:
  password is morbNTDkSW6jIlUc0ymOdMaLnOlFVAaj.The start directory was empty so i ran "cd .." and then ls and saw a bunch of stuff. I then ran "ls -aR -l | grep "33" | grep "bandit7"" and foudn that the password was stored in a file called
  bandit7.password. I then ran "find -name "*.password* | grep "bandit7"" to find the path of said file which was ./var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password. Then ran cat bandit7.password
level 7->8:
  password is dfwvzFQi4mU0wfNbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc. i ran "find data.txt" and saw it was right there. then I ran grep "millionth" data.txt.
level 8->9:
  password is 4CKMh1JI91bUIZZPXDqGanal4xvAg0JM. i ran " sort -r data.txt | uniq -u"
level 9->10:
  password is FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey. I ran "strings data.txt" and looked at the line with all the equal signs.
level 10->11:
  password is dtR173fZKb0RRsDFSGsg2RWnpNVj3qRr. I ran "base64 -d data.txt"
level 11->12:
